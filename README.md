Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) and Systemic Risk
This project investigates the use of Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) models to assess and manage systemic risk in financial markets. By analyzing the time-varying correlations between asset returns, this approach aims to enhance understanding of market interdependencies and potential risk transmission during periods of financial stress.

Overview
Systemic risk refers to the potential for widespread financial instability, often triggered by correlated failures among financial institutions. Traditional risk assessment models may overlook the dynamic relationships between assets. This project employs DCC models to capture these relationships and provide insights into how risks propagate through financial systems.

Key Features
DCC Model Implementation: Implementation of the DCC-GARCH model to estimate time-varying correlations between financial assets.
Systemic Risk Assessment: Tools to analyze systemic risk levels and identify vulnerable assets or sectors.
Visualization: Graphical representations of correlation dynamics and risk measures over time, facilitating a clearer understanding of systemic risk patterns.
Technologies Used
Python
Statsmodels
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization
